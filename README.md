# Warehouse Simulator

This project contains a small Electron application that demonstrates a basic
supply chain simulator. The backend logic is organized under the `simulator/`
folder and data is stored as JSON in `data/`.

## Running the App

```bash
npm install   # install Electron
npm start     # launch the desktop app
```

Use the buttons in the UI to add a sample entity or advance the simulation
step. The current state will be printed on screen for debugging.
