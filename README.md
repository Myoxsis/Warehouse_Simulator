# Stock Simulator

Status: Under Development

This tool uses [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) to simulate warehouse inventory and order flows. A simple Electron interface can be used to run the Python simulation and view its output.

## Running the Electron app

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Click **Run Simulation** to execute the Python script and stream the output.
